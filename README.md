A fully responsive MERN stack application that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives. The app allows users to register/login using a simple authentication or simply login using their google account to post their favourite memories. Each post can be expanded by clicking on it, which shows more details about the event. Once a user is logged in, users can also like/unlike any post and delete/edit their own posts. The app also features a search function to search for posts either by tags or by the name of the event.
